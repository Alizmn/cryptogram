          Bitcoin (₿) (BTC) is a decentralized virtual digital currency that can
          be sent between users through the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network,
          without the need for intermediaries like banks or governments. It was
          the first example of a cryptocurrency, a growing asset class that
          shares some characteristics of traditional currencies, but has
          verification based on cryptography. The term ‘Bitcoin’ can refer to
          the token (a snippet of code that represents ownership of a digital
          value) or it can refer to the technology (a distributed network that
          maintains the ledger of balances of the Bitcoin token). The idea for
          Bitcoin and blockchain was first published in an online cryptography
          forum in November 2008, by an anonymous person (or group) called
          Satoshi Nakamoto. The white paper, entitled ‘Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer
          Electronic Cash System’ outlined an electronic payment system based on
          mathematical proof, and explained how the different parts of the
          Bitcoin protocol would operate and be kept secure. It further
          described how a new type of database called a blockchain would keep
          track of the history of all Bitcoin transactions, and be maintained by
          everyone in the network.
